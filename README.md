# Personal Project: Conception
*Conception: design (in French)*

The application would essentially be a tool that would allow a user to design rooms of a house from top 
view. The user will be able to start with a square room with the dimension of their choice. Then they would be able to 
place furniture of various sizes in the rooms in the position and alignment of their choice. At initial stage, the user 
would only be able to design a single square room. At later stages of the project, however,  I would add an option that
would allow the users to add multiple rooms in the house.

Because of its simple and efficient working mechanism, this application could be used by anybody that wants to design 
their own house or wants to learn architectural drawing and design but it would be of special help to new architects 
and architecture students.

This project is of interest to me because in the past, I have tried learning architectural drawing and designing 
but failed to do so because of the complexity of the tools. I, therefore, wanted to design a simple yet efficient 
tool that would help new architects and architecture students or just anyone who wants to explore new fields like I 
tried doing.
