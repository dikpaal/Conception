# My Personal Project

The application would essentially be a tool that would allow a user to design rooms of a house from top 
view. This application could be used by anybody but it owuld be of special help for architects and architecture students.

This project is of interest to me because in the past, I have tried learning architectural drawing and designing 
but failed to do so because of the complexity of the tools. I, therefore, wanted to design a simple yet efficient 
tool that would help new architects and architecture students or just anyone who wants to explore new fields like I 
tried doing.
